# powergrid
A full HTTP API implementation of the board game Power Grid written by me for educational purposes.

Written in PHP5 using [Slim](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim), the [Propel ORM](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel), and [Ruler](https://github.com/bobthecow/Ruler).

# Development Status
Power Grid is not complete. Since it's a pet project, I am going very slowly and methodically, refactoring a lot and planning decisions. It feels good to do that.

Right now, Power Grid can only register users and start games, but no game actions can be taken.

Soon. Maybe. Depending on how much time I can dedicate.
